Pinecone employees should see development information in [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### What is Homebrew?

Homebrew is a package manager primarily used by Mac OS and some Linux users. See  [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) for details. 

Before you can use formulas from our tap, you must [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### What is a Tap?

This is Pinecone's official [Homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps). Homebrew taps contain formulas telling your computer how to install software that is not included in [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core).
